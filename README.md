# Building_Sec_Monitoring
Within a security team environment, build an enterprise Splunk-based SIEM environment dashboard to monitor website traffic before and in response to a simulated attack, presenting findings to the University of Minnesota Bootcamp class.

Activities:
- Utilizing Splunk for log agregation, inspect both Apache and Windows logs to establish enterprise baseline activity.
- Using established baselines observed, establish and create Splunk alerts when activity is seen over reasonable thresholds as early IOCs/IOAs.
- Research and implement Splunk "Add-On" Applications to assist with monitoring possible attack vectors.
- Create customized Splunk dashboard to assist in continuous monitoring.
- Evaluate normal activity logs versus "attack logs" to determine effectiveness of alerts/baselining.
